      <p className="message">My dearest Baby,</p>
      <p className="message">As I sit down to write this letter, my heart overflows with love for you. There are not enough words in any language to truly express how much you mean to me.</p>
      <p className="message">You came into my life like a beautiful sunrise, coloring my world with hues of joy, passion, and unconditional love. With you, I've discovered parts of myself I never knew existed.</p>

        <div className="poem-line">An Ode to Baby, Written while listening to Beanie by Chezile.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">Are you that cute</div>
        <div className="poem-line">or you're the face of chamomile petals?</div>
        <div className="poem-line">I love you without knowing how and why.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">You came into my life while I was looking for no one,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">when I had reserved my love for the one.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">My dear, we have just met,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">You've got to witness the sweetness of me,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">And me, the tenderness of you,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">I'm still longing to hear your voice,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">to put me to sleep so I only dream of you.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">My foggy mind is lighter at the thought that you're mine,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">I will write your name on the island's sand,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">and draw a circle with our daughter's name inside too,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">For she will follow your cuteness and inherit your mind and</div>
        <div className="poem-line">your hair too.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">At night me, you and our kids are singing at the table,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">For we'll be celebrating your braveness and my name.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">I will kiss you three times on your left fluffy cheek,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">Five on your right, hundred on your forehead cute as peacock,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">I'll kiss you everytime on the back of your palms,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">And infinite times on your honey lips.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">Stay a little longer in my dreams,</div>
        <div className="poem-line">my love for this boy is only a dreamer.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">Don't let me wake up, still tasting your name.</div>
        <div className="poem-line">So tell me mama, are you that cute</div>
        <div className="poem-line">or you're the face of chamomile petals?</div>
      </div>
      
      <p className="message">On this Valentine's Day, I want to thank you for being you. Thank you for loving me, for believing in me, and for walking this journey of life by my side.</p>
      <p className="message">No matter what the future holds, know that my love for you is constant and unwavering. You are, and will always be, the love of my life.</p>
